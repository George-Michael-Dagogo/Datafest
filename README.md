# Background: Problem statement

Goodness and Mercy School (GMS) is a mid-level private primary and secondary school in Kaduna South local government of Kaduna state, Nigeria. A hypothetical situation featured a stakeholders meeting highlighting the lack of infrastructure for digital data collection plus the inadequate paper records being kept. Also, the results from the 2024 UTME showed that 76% (approx. 4 out of 5) of students who participated in the 2024 UTME scored [less than 200](https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/690022-updated-jamb-releases-2024-utme-results-76-scores-below-200.html). This has raised a huge concern for the stakeholders and hence they have decided to take proactive measures to guard against this failure rate for their next batch of students in their upcoming final exams and consequently the JAMB and WASSCE exams.

The **Phoenix team (Hannah Igboke, Michael George, and Olawumi Olabode)** has been called in as consultants by the stakeholders at GMS to set up a scalable data infrastructure system and build a solution that proactively leverages data to improve candidates’ performance in not just JAMB, but all their upcoming final exams. After a careful review of the state of the school's data system, the team has broken down the problem statement into the following objectives to be tackled.

## Objectives

1. Identify possible problems students might be facing while writing these exams
2. Since no concrete data was provided, we are required to generate data that adequately reflects the state of the Nigerian education ecosystem
3. Design an enterprise data solution for GMS’s data collection, pipelining, warehousing, automation, and reporting needs.
4. Create an optimized model that predicts the likelihood of a student passing or failing their upcoming exam based on their academic history while considering all factors that could affect a student's upcoming result aside from their previous exam scores.
5. Make relevant recommendations to the Stakeholders on how they can help improve the performance of the students based on your solution

The solution workflow can be seen below.

# Assumptions
This refers to some assumptions made during building this solution. These assumptions in the real world translate to guiding principles the school operates by such as:
1.	Compulsory extra-curricular activities
2.	10 subjects are being offered by students in both specializations – Art and Science, with 5 subjects common between them.


# Model development and deployment

The task here
Here, we have the aggregate scores for the SS3 students for their academic year in SS3 that is first, second, and third terms.

Now, their upcoming exams here refer to the mock exams to prepare them for JAMB and WAEC. Their performance in the just concluded academic year as well as other factors that might have affected their academic performance during the past session is used to predict students' performance in their upcoming exams. Also, the model being built is divided into two for art and for science students.
